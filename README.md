# CareerMind AI — Django Project

A Django recreation of the CareerMind AI academic career-intelligence platform
(landing page, signup/login, dashboard, skill gap analysis, resume analyzer,
learning roadmap, and AI chatbot), matching the maroon/gold/cream design from
the reference screenshots.

## Recent changes (integration pass)

- Role enforcement is done in the backend on every portal URL (`roles/decorators.py`);
  the role chosen on the login screen is never trusted. Student pages redirect other
  roles to their own dashboard; staff/alumni/admin pages return 403 to other roles.
- Student dashboard, Resume Analyzer, Skill Analysis and the AI assistant now show
  values computed from the student's real resume/goal data (`core/metrics.py`).
  Nothing is shown before a resume exists except an empty state.
- A saved Career Goal now drives Skill Analysis and the Learning Path
  (`core/skill_matching.resolve_requirements`); the original per-role list remains
  as the fallback when no goal/requirements exist.
- Alumni job/internship posts start as *Pending* and only appear to students after
  Admin approval (Approve / Reject / Close, with confirmation dialogs).
- Shared UI helpers: `static/js/app.js` (toasts, confirm dialogs via `data-confirm`,
  CSRF-aware `CM.post`).

Run `python manage.py test` (50 tests) after any change.

### Demo logins (created by `seed_demo`)

| Role   | Email                     | Password         |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Staff  | `staff.demo@shc.edu`      | `CareerMind@2026` |
| Alumni | `alumni.demo@shc.edu`     | `CareerMind@2026` |
| Admin  | `admin.demo@shc.edu`      | `CareerMind@2026` |

Logging in through `/login/` now redirects each role to its own dashboard
automatically (Student → `/dashboard/`, Staff → `/staff/`, Alumni →
`/alumni/`, Admin → `/admin-panel/`). A new Student can still sign up at
`/signup/` exactly as before.

admin site is still at `/admin/`, unchanged.

## How it's put together

- Auth uses Django's built-in `User` model; the email address is used as the
  username (see `core/forms.py`).
- `core/models.py` defines `Profile` (readiness score, resume score, target
  role, etc.) and `Skill` (per-user skill inventory). A `Profile` plus a
  default skill set (`DEFAULT_SKILLS`) is created automatically on signup.
- All dashboard numbers are **mock/demo data** seeded per user — swap in real
  calculations (resume parsing, ML matching, etc.) by editing
  `core/views.py` and `core/models.py`.
- Charts (line, radar, bar, doughnut) use Chart.js via CDN; Tailwind CSS is
  loaded via the Tailwind CDN script for speed. Swap both for a real build
  pipeline (django-tailwind, a bundler, compiled Chart.js) before shipping to
  production.
- The chatbot's replies are simple keyword-based canned responses in
  `views.chatbot_reply` — swap that view for a real LLM/API call when ready.
- `templates/core/base.html` is the shared shell (sidebar + topbar) used by
  every logged-in page; `landing.html`, `login.html`, and `signup.html` are
  standalone full-page templates.
